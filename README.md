# calculator

This is a basic calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two user-inputted numbers. The program handles all possible exceptions and use cases, including dividing by zero, inputting non-numeric values, and accounting for negative numbers and decimals.

Here's how the program works:

It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, \*, or /).  
It uses the getNumber method to read in the numbers, and the getOperator method to read in the operator.  
It uses a switch statement to perform the appropriate calculation based on the operator.  
If the user attempts to divide by zero or enters an invalid operator, the program throws an exception and displays an error message.
